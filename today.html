            <h1>The Loch Ness Monster Sightings</h1>
            <h2>Reported: November 3, 2025</h2>
            <p>
               I was on the shore of Loch Ness at dawn when something <strong>huge</strong> broke 
               the water. At first, I thought it was a log, but then a long, <em>sinister</em> 
               neck rose slowly. Two glowing eyes reflected the light. It moved silently, leaving 
               ripples, then vanished.
            </p>
            <p>
               Other tourists said they saw it too. Photos were <strong>blurry</strong>, nothing 
               <em>clear</em>. Everyone whispered about <em>Nessie</em>. For a few moments, I 
               couldn’t stop staring, hoping it would appear again.
            </p>
